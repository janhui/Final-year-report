\section{Motivation}
Being a 90s kid we were exposed to an impressive array of gadgets through various blockbuster movies and television (TV) shows such as Star Wars and Star Trek. One of the unfortunate consequences of growing up is learning that majority of these gadgets are are just superficial and there are no product that actually meets the feats showed in the movies. It burst our bubble makes us wish there was something that would be as good. 

Some of these have come to fruition over the years like the Smart watches, tablets etc. There are some that are still under development like the Google Glass, self driving cars. Then came the recent movies like Iron Man with more remarkable gadgets like the Iron Man suit and the J.A.R.V.I.S system.
