\subsection{Summary}
After careful consideration of the available options we had, we decided to that Java will be our language of choice and Android as the platform. Mainly due to our familiarity with both as well as the fact that android devices have a larger market share, therefore more people are likely to have one in their possession.  We decided to use OpenCV as our vision library due to its cross platform availability and also because it worked on all hardware. It also had the added bonus of being the more mature library compared to FastCV.

We decided to use contour detection and colour detection for our main graphics manipulation and device identification, since both were less demanding compared to the alternatives. They were the most efficient of the choices due to the limited resources available on the devices. Using something that worked well with a less powerful processor and smaller memory was one of the priorities of this project.

We also decided to use Firebase as the data store of our system because of its real time data synchronisation abilities. The opportunity to get real time update and to push data from the storage without having to worry about concurrency issues was too good to pass.
