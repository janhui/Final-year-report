\section{Introduction}
 
The biggest obstacle currently faced by HuddleLamp project is the antiquation of the Creative Senz3d camera and the Intel Perpetual SDK\cite{obsolete_perpetual_sdk}. This means that at the time of writing this report, it is difficult to contribute towards the HuddleLamp project. In this section we will look at using an Android device as an alternative to the camera currently used by the HuddleLamp group. We will attempt to port the HuddleLamp software to an Android platform and attempt to create it without a Time of Flight camera and find a substitute for the depth information.

We will introduce the two apps that was created for this project. One being the substitute camera application called CameraApp doing the major vision calculations and finding the positions of the devices on the table. Second being the TableApp which handles the gesture control and shows the information on the table. Firstly we will attempt to give a balanced view of all the major decisions we had to take for these applications and try to justify the decisions.
