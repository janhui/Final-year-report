\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof Julie McCann, for proposing the project and
providing me with constant support throughout this project and for her ideas, advice and helping me focus my goals on the more realistic targets.
Thanks also to Dr. Hans-Christian Jetter  and Roman RÃ¤dle for giving me access to HuddleLamp and aiding me to build on top of it. 

I would personally like to thank Prof Daniel Rueckert for his valuable input on the topic of Computer Vision without which I would not have been able to accomplish as much as I did.

Thanks also to my family and friends for their ongoing and unconditional support throughout my time here.

\end{acknowledgements}
