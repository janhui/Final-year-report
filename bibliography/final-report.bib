@article{wifi-indoor,
abstract = {This paper presents an aided dead-reckoning navigation structure and signal processing algorithms for self localization of an autonomous mobile device by fusing pedestrian dead reckoning and WiFi signal strength measurements. WiFi and inertial navigation systems (INS) are used for positioning and attitude determination in a wide range of applications. Over the last few years, a number of low-cost inertial sensors have become available. Although they exhibit large errors, WiFi measurements can be used to correct the drift weakening the navigation based on this technology. On the other hand, INS sensors can interact with the WiFi positioning system as they provide high-accuracy real-time navigation. A structure based on a Kalman filter and a particle filter is proposed. It fuses the heterogeneous information coming from those two independent technologies. Finally, the benefits of the proposed architecture are evaluated and compared with the pure WiFi and INS positioning systems.},

@inproceedings{sig-cart,
abstract = {In urbanized and indoor environments, outdoor positioning systems, such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), are often inaccurate and adaptations of such systems to those contexts are expensive and hard to deploy. Nowadays, a lot of indoor positioning techniques have been studied, but it it quite difficult to objectively evaluate and compare their accuracies in the same environment. Our Open Wireless Positioning System (OWLPS) allows a comparison of indoor positioning algorithms and techniques with the same input data. Those techniques include propagation models, signal strength map, building topology, description of access points... Few algorithms use a Viterbi-like algorithm to take into account the pathway of the mobile terminal. This paper presents a new hybrid algorithm combining a signal strength cartography and a calibrated propagation model. Finally, we compare our solution with well known algorithms in order to evaluate the results in a real context.},
