\subsection{Summary}
Similar to Section \ref{ch:devcamera}, I have decided to carry on in a similar vein and chose Java as my language for this implementation and to create an Android project for similar reasons. I decided to go with Estimote beacons as my choice for the beacons to use due to the mature API they had and also because of the level of online support there was. Having a rapport with community developer at the company also meant I was able to get some unfettered access. 

For my RF medium, I have decided to go with BLE, because BLE is an exciting new feature which doesnt require a device to "pair" with other devices. The passive monitoring feature is something I could utilise to find out the position of the algorithm. For my positioning algorithm, I have decided to go with a hybrid of Trilateration and INS. I am hoping both of them together will aid in giving a fairly accurate positioning values for my devices.
