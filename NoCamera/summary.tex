\subsection{Summary}
Similar to Section \ref{ch:devcamera}, we have decided to carry on in a similar vein and chose Java as our language for this implementation and to create an Android project for similar reasons. We decided to go with Estimote beacons as our choice for the beacons due to the mature API they had and also because of the level of online support available. Having a rapport with the community developer at the company also meant we were able to get some unfettered access. 

For our RF medium, we have decided to go with BLE, because BLE is an exciting new feature which do not require a device to ``pair" with other devices. The passive monitoring feature is also something we could utilise to find out the position of the algorithm. For the positioning algorithm, we have decided to go with a hybrid of Trilateration and INS. We are hoping that both of them together will aid in giving fairly accurate positioning values for our devices.
